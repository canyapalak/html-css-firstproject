            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="p1">It was just a dream in the beginning. Two high school friends who want to create a food brand that people will love to
            consume... Years later, when their paths crossed in Berlin, they rolled up their sleeves to make this dream come true.
            They decided on hamburger, which was their favorite meal as a child, and wanted to take it to the next level. They
            rented an old laundry in Prenzlauer Berg and furnished it with a sophisticated taste. The next stage was the food supply. They took over their parents' farm in Branderburger and turned it into a huge
            production centre. But that was not enough. Now they needed reliable chefs to deliver these foods to. They hired two experienced chefs who had worked in Michelin-starred restaurants before and developed Burger Point's first ever 
            hamburger: Mushroom Dream! The result was amazing and this inspired them to invent more! That is how the special menu of Burger Point was created.
            </p>
            <h2>Top-Quality Ingredients</h2>
          <div class="fresh">

          </div>
            <p class="p1">Our food at Burger Point stands for two things: quality and regional origin. That's why we offer 100% fresh food from our
            farm in Brandenburger Bavaria to our guests. By working together closely with our farmers we make
            sure our guests at Burger Point get the best burger. And you can definitely taste it! We are also extremely proud of our burger buns and sauces. Thanks to our homemade recipes, our guests at
            Burger Point can enjoy the perfect burgers with fluffy buns and tasty sauces at the same time. We bake our buns and cook our sauces fresh every day so we can
            offer the best quality to our customers. Combined with the other ingredients, these two main elements lay the foundation for
            our burgers.</p>
            <h2>Our Place</h2>
            <p class="p1" style="margin-bottom:100px">We believe that eating is an experience. For this reason, we wanted to create a unique experience for each of our guests
            during the time they spend in our restaurant. Our venue, which we have arranged as a mixture of Bauhaus and Bavarian
            style, is the most suitable place for this job! Perfect moments await you at Burger Point, where we combine the
            metropolitan atmosphere of Berlin with the rusticity of rural life in Bavarian villages.</p>
